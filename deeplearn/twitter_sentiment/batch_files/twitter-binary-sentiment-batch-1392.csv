1	Google Wave looks pretty interesting. Appeals to my inner nerd
0	google wave will allow others to tag your messages, this will not help me with my Inbox 15,328 (and counting) strategy 
1	Google Wave will not hurt twitter, but improve it, with a little robot thingy that updates directly to your twitter 
1	Google Wave: Simply awesome
1	Google Waverines? Has anyone got hold of a Google Wave account, yet? 
0	Google, I love you, but I am having the utmost difficulties sorting out my accounts. I'm sure it's my fault, but just letting you know...
